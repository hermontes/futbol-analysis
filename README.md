In this analysis, I decided to cover the top fútbol leagues. For our analysis, we will focus on the Big 5 European fútbol leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1. These leagues are widely recognized as being among the most competitive and prestigious in Europe, and they attract many of the world's top players and teams.

The dataset we will use for our analysis includes team statistics for from the 2010-2011 to 2020-2021 season for all teams in the top 5 European leagues. The data is organized into several columns, including league, season, points, games played, wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded, and goal difference.

It can be challenging to determine which of the top 5 leagues is the most competitive based on just watching the games. In this tutorial, we will analyze the data to try to answer the question of which league is the most competitive.
